## Releasing

This project uses GitHub Releases for its release process. Once a release occurs on GitHub, Packagist is automatically notified of the release via a webhook.

Each release should have a title that corresponds to the semantic version. The tag should also correspond to the semantic version, for example "1.0.0". The body should include the releases relevant changes.

For more info on GitHub releases, visit the [Managing releases in a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository) help doc.
